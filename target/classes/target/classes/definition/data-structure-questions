Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. Data Structures are used to increase the efficiency and performance of an application by organizing the data
    in such a manner that it requires less space with higher processing speed.



What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. Sorting, Merging, Deleting, Inserting, Searching and more.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.

what is an Array?
A. An array is a collection of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be
   individually referenced by using an index to a unique identifier.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. Array is a fixed length data structure whereas ArrayList is a variable length Collection class. We cannot
   change length of array once created in Java but ArrayList can be changed. We cannot store primitives in ArrayList,
    it can only store objects. But array can contain both primitives and objects in Java.

what is LinkedList?
A. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next
   node in the list.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of
   elements of the same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.

what is queue?
A. Queue in Java is a linear-ordered data structure that follows FIFO (First In, First Out) ordering of elements.
    This means that the element inserted first in the queue will be the first element to be removed.

what is stack?
A. Stacks in Data Structures is a linear type of data structure that follows the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
   principle and allows insertion and deletion operations from one end of the stack data structure, that is top.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. First in, first out (FIFO). It is a method for handling data structures where the first
    element is processed first and the newest element is processed last. Last in, first out (LIFO),  It is a method for
    handling data structures where the last element is processed first and the first element is processed last.

what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. Sequential search is the best that we can do when trying to find a value in an unsorted array.
   But if the array is sorted in increasing order by value, then we can use a process called binary search.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. The worst-case performance is when the search item appears at the end of the list or not at all.

what is tree in data structure?
A. A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent value and nodes
   are connected by edges. A tree has the following properties: The tree has one node called root. The tree originates
    from this, which means it does not have any parent.

what is graph in data structure?
A. A graph is a non-linear kind of data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges. The edges connect
   any two nodes in the graph, and the nodes are also known as vertices.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. HashMap is non-synchronized whereas Hashtable is synchronized, which means Hashtable is thread-safe and can
   be shared between multiple threads but HashMap can not be shared between multiple threads without proper synchronization.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.

How HashMap works in java?
A. Hashmap is a collection of key-value pairs and an array of nodes. It uses an array and LinkedList for storing key-value pairs.
   Hashmap also uses a method called Hashing that converts an object into integer form through Hashcoding.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. When the index is outside the bounds -- less than zero OR greater than the array size minus one.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. using loops or the built-in array copy method

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. Linked List is an ordered collection of
   elements of the same type in which each element is connected to the next using pointers.

What is DFS and BFS?
A. Using source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bfs-and-dfs/

       DFS, Depth First Search, is an edge-based technique. It uses the Stack data structure and performs two stages,
       first visited vertices are pushed into the stack, and second if there are no vertices then visited vertices are popped.

       BFS, Breadth-First Search, is a vertex-based technique for finding the shortest path in the graph.
       It uses a Queue data structure that follows first in first out. In BFS,
       one vertex is selected at a time when it is visited and marked then its adjacent are visited and stored in the queue.
       It is slower than DFS.

What is Recursion?
A. When calling the method inside of the method.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. Arrays, stacks, linked lists, and queues are the forms of a linear data structure.
   Trees, graphs, are the forms of a non-linear data structure.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big O Notation in Data Structure is used to express algorithmic complexity using algebraic terms. It describes
   the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime and calculates the time and amount of memory needed to execute the algorithm
    for an input value.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a t/able with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
